# Changelog

## 0.0.1

Initial creation of the NodeJS Agent. Key differences with the Browser Agent:

- No helper functions, `attempt`, `watch`, or `watchAll`.
- No Visitor or Navigation Telemetry.
- Fewer options to configure environment integration. (Wait until we need them)
- No ability to customize the serializer. I think this is unused.
